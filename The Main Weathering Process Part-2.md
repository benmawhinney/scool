#### Freeze-Thaw

Occurs in areas where the temperature regularly drops below **0Â°C.**

Water enters **cracks** in the rock during the day. Overnight the temperature drops and the water **freezes.** As it freezes, it **expands.**

The expanded ice places **pressure** on the rocks around it.

Over time this constant pressuring of the rock causes it to **crack** and **split.**

#### Exfoliation

Occurs in hot, dry climates.

The outer layer of the rock is **heated** by the sun during the day, causing it to **expand,** during the night, as the temperature drops, the rock **contracts**. This constant expanding and contracting eventually leads to the outer layers of the rock **pealing away,** leaving behind them rounded rocks and dome shaped **outcrops.**

#### Hydrolysis

Attacks rocks, which include feldspar crystals, the most common example being granite.

The feldspar reacts with **acidic rainwater** and **dissolves** to form kaolin (china clay).

The remainder of the rock breaks up into its individual **crystals** overtime.

#### Carbonation & solution

Occurs on rocks containing calcium carbonate, such as **limestone** and **chalk.**

Rainwater and dissolved carbon dioxide mix to form a weak carbonic acid.

Calcium carbonate in the rocks reacts with the acidic water and dissolves leaving behind calcium bicarbonate.

This compound is soluble and is easily washed away by running water.
