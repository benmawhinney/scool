# Overall classifications

## Igneous rocks

**Igneous rocks** are fire formed.

They originate from the magma in the mantle of the Earth.

Extrusive igneous rocks are formed by being thrown out during a volcanic eruption. They cool very quickly once they reach the surface.

An example of an extrusive igneous rock is **basalt.**

Intrusive igneous rocks are formed under the surface of the earth, cooling very slowly to form a large area of rock under the surface of the earth.

An example of an intrusive igneous rock is **granite.**


## Sedimentary rocks

Over millions of years the actions of rivers, glaciers and the wind produce large amounts of small particles called **sediments.**

These accumulated on sea floors in layers, and due to the pressure of material above they were compressed to form rocks.

***Examples include:***

- **Sandstone**, which is made from compressed sand;

- **Clay,** which is made from compressed mud;

- **Coal,** which is made from the compressed remains of ancient forests;

- **Chalk** and **limestone,** which is made from the compressed remains of plants and animals.



## Metamorphic rocks

Rocks which have been changed in shape or form, usually by heat or pressure, are called **metamorphic rocks.**

They begin as either igneous or sedimentary rocks before being changed, usually in areas of high pressure and intense heat, such as plate margins.

Examples include **slate** (which used to be clay) and **marble** (which used to be limestone).
